## Description
It consists of a web application regarding a takeaway pizzeria, where employees can manage orders and deliveries, whereas customers can place their orders in a fully automated way, create new pizzas and easily pay their meals. The front-end is built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The back-end is based on a PostgreSQL database and it is built using Java servlets, which exploited JDBC, JSP and REST technologies.
